# Development Tools Installation for Microchip WFI32-IoT Board (Part No. EV36W50A)

## Install Software Required for the Host Computer

1. Microchip `MPLAB X` tool chain for embedded code development on 32-bit architecture MCU/MPU platforms (made up of 3 major components)

    - [MPLAB X IDE (minimum v6.00)](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)

    - [MPLAB XC32 Compiler (minimum v4.10)](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers#tabs)

        NOTE: This demonstration project was tested successfully with XC32 v4.10, and in general should work with later versions of the compiler as they become available. If you encounter issues building the project with a newer version of the compiler, it is recommended to download XC32 v4.10 from the [MPLAB Development Ecosystem Downloads Archive](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/archives/mplab-ecosystem) (to fall back to the version Microchip successfully tested prior to release). 

     - [MPLAB Harmony Software Framework](https://microchipdeveloper.com/harmony3:mhc-overview)

2. [Git](https://git-scm.com) (a free and open source distributed version control system)

- Download/install the latest version ofÂ [Git for Windows, macOS, or Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- Verify working operation of the `Git Bash` prompt (e.g. for Windows: click `Start` > type `Git Bash`)

3. Any [Terminal Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators) program of your choice
